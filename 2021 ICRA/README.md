# Bringing WALL-E out of the Silver Screen: Understanding How Transformative Robot Sound Affects Human Perception

**This submission is currently under review.** 

Each folder contains the videos used in the study or in all studies ("Common"). Stimuli videos for each study have the following naming convention:
`SoundCondition-RobotBehavior-BehaviorNickname.mp4`
For instance, a video with transformative sound may read `TransformedSound-BehaviorA-Something.mp4`. For more explanation of the study design and stimuli, please see Section III (Methods) of the associated paper. 

Before viewing the stimuli, we recommend watching `Common/Volume-Calibration.mp4` to tune your device's volume to an appropriate level.
